# Introduction

This is my dissertation. I want to keep it versioned and make the text
available to all for comment and improvement.

Just like code can be open source created, so too can a work of history.
History is made by many people, so it takes many people to write about history
accurately.

If you would like to participate in making this history more accurate, send me
an email <ammon@nazitunnels.org> with any corrections, or if you're technically inclined, add an issue
in the [Github](http://github.com/mossiso/dissertation/) repo.
